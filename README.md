# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The game allows two players to compete against each other: one player is the user, and the other player is the computer.

## Rules

The rules for winning a single round are as follows:
- Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
- Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
- Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)

## Features

- Play against the computer in an infinite loop until the user decides to quit.
- User can choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) using a command-line prompt.
- The computer's move is randomly generated.
- The game keeps track of the overall score and displays it after each round.
- The user can quit the game at any time, and the overall winner is determined based on the score.
